This was my 3rd homework for Georgia Tech's coding bootcamp. 

In this homework, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an app that picks a random letter and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.

The sections consisted of:
 - Guess what letter I am thinking of
 - Wins
 - Losses
 - Guesses Left
 - Your Guesses So Far

* When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again
        (without refreshing the page) <-- This needs to be worked on
        
* When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game
        (without refreshing the page) <-- This needs to be worked on
